# Curve API

All endpoints are cached for around 10 minutes (some less). 
Requests can be made to the following URL: https://api.curve.fi/api/

## How to add a new endpoint

1. Create a new file under `/pages/api`: the endpoint will be accessible through the same path, e.g. `/pages/api/hithere` would accessible through `api.curve.fi/api/hithere`
2. If this endpoint requires passing any data as a query parameter, name that parameter in the path itself (e.g. `/pages/api/user/[id].js`)
3. The endpoint script must export a function, wrapped in the utility `fn()`, that returns a json object â€“ that's it
4. **Query params:** any query params defined as in (2) are accessible in the first argument passed to `fn`, e.g. `fn(({ id }) => ({ message: \`Id passed as argument: ${id}\`}))`
5. **Caching:** pass an object as second argument to `fn`, and set the cache duration in seconds with the `maxAge` property: `{ maxAge: 60 }`
